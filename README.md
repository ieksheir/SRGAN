# SRGAN OCT Image Resolution Enhancement
This Assignment builds an SR - GAN network that train to enhance the resolution of OCT scans from 32x32 pixels to 128x128. 

File Descriptions:
  - ModelA: Trains a classifier on the original dataset with images resized to 128x128.
  - SRGAN: Trains an SR GAN Network that can generate a 128x128 size image from a 32x32 image input. The model is saved and used in modelB.
  - ModelB: Trains a classifier on the dataset of images sized 128x128 generated by running inference of the model obtained from the SRGAN.
  
To reproduce results:
  - dowload all .ipynb files
  - adjust any directories acccordingly
  - The three notebooks are run independently of one another
